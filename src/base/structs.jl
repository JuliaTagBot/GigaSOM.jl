    Som

Structure to hold all data of a trained SOM.

# Fields:
- `codes::Array{Float64,2}`: 2D-array of codebook vectors. One vector per row
- `colNames::Array{String,1}`: names of the attribute with which the SOM is trained
- `xdim::Int`: number of neurons in x-direction
- `ydim::Int`: number of neurons in y-direction
- `numCodes::Int`: total number of neurons
- `grid::Array{Float64,2}`: 2D-array of coordinates of neurons on the map
          (2 columns (x,y)] for rectangular and hexagonal maps
           3 columns (x,y,z) for spherical maps)

    LoadedDataInfo

The basic structure for working with loaded data, distributed amongst workers. In completeness, it represents a dataset as such:

- `val` is the "value name" under which the data are saved in processes. E.g.
  `val=:foo` means that there is a variable `foo` on each process holding a
  part of the matrix.
- `workers` is a list of workers (in correct order!) that hold the data
  (similar to `DArray.pids`)
